## Current State of the Array
Parts: Cameras, Lights, Ethernet Cables, BNC cables, Power Canvas.

### Cameras
All the cameras are mounted except for camera 95, because we need the large bolts to mount it properly and it's ethernet port doesn't work.

Cameras 92, 93, and 95 are the color cameras.

**TODO:** to adjust the angles of all the 1,2,3,and 4 cameras to focus on the center of the ring. 

### Lights
All the lights are mounted and just need ethernet cord connections.

### BNC Cables
We technically have enough BNC cables to do all the connections. Unused we have 

- 2 1m cables
- 4 2m cables
- 4 3m cables
- 9 6m cables
- 4 long cables

Where we currently need 15 6in connectors to connect the camera pairs, and 20 connectors.

**TODO:** Get connectors and maybe some short wires from the US.

### Ethernet cables
For the Lights we currently have one ring wired up, which leaves 32 left. So we need a minimum of 32 2m cables.

For the cameras on the desktop side of the array we have the first 5 rings of cameras 1-3 wired. This uses 6m cables for the 1 cameras, 4m for the 2 cameras, and 2m for the 3 cameras. For the next 5 rings we need the same thing, so 5 each of 6m, 4m and 2m cables. 

For the cameras on the old tunnel side we are currently using some of the non ideal long wires, so we can replace them with better length cables. For this probably 6 2m cables, 8 4m cables, 6 6m cables.

This leaves, in all, **TO MAKE**:

- 43 2m cables
- 13 4m cables
- 11 6m cables

### Canvas
**TODO:** Actually setup the canvas. Figure out how best to poke holes for the cameras and microphones in the canvas.

### Power Cables
We have all the required cords, just need to wait for the electricians to install the outlets and then run the power lines for the cameras and lights.

### Running the Array
**TODO:** Working out a synchronization strategy if they aren't triggered at the same time. In post processing if necessary. How to back out the camera positions and matrices based on a calibration target.
