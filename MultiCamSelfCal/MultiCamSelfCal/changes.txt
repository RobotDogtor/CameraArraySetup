Fixed Bugs in Code:

- configdata ... handling of missing config files


Functionality or Fixed bugs in it :

- You can now basially set all you need in the configdata. A
  modification of gocal or im2points is not needed anymore. Unless you
  really know what you are doing

- The algorithm first tries to load data from the mono-processor
  version of LED finding. If not succeed it tries to load the
  multiproc data. This default behavior might be supressed if needed
  by setting USED_MULTIPROC = 1; in the gocal.m. However, the default
  behavior should be OK in most of the cases.

- algorithms handles images with different resolutions correctly

- NUM_CAMS_FILL (in gocal) ... now compared with the number of
  available cameras and decreased if necessary

- required sub-pixel accuracy. You can set the required scale of the
  subpixel precision in the configdata.m in config.imgs.subpix.
  If not specified, default 1/3 is assigned. You can do some quick
  try-and-see tests by setting this value to 1. 

- speed up of the Finding LEDs. However, only for smaller LEDs up to
  7-9 pixels in diameter. For the bigger neighbourhoods and the higher
  sub-pixel precision required, like oscar (big LED), the older
  version might be faster. Check the variable BLK_PROC in getpoint.m

- the graphical outputs (if required) from getpoint.m made more clear

- support for selfcalibration of systems consisting of cameras and
  projectors added. See the "oscar" experiment. Only single processor
  version im2points.m works properly for this.



Balancing speed and precision:

The Matlab function "imread" for reading the images
is appearently not one of the fastest. It does not make sense to go
beyond subpixel=1/2 for LEDs <= 7 pixels. The most of the time is
spent in reading images anyway.

However, for big LEDs >13, it may save a lot of time to set the value
to 1 or 1/2 against 1/3 or 1/4.
